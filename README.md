# DevERP-Simplified

Hello and welcome to DevERP Simplified. The aim of this project is to develop and dispense a standard pipeline for analyzing developmental EEG data for ERPs while concurrently providing an easily readible framework for researchers to conduct ERP and EEG analysis regardless of prior coding abilities. For documentation, instructions on how to install and further information, please see the wikis found [here](https://github.com/w-decker/DevERP-Simplified/wiki).
